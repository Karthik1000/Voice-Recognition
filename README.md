# Voice_recognition
<b> Abstract </b><br>
Speaker Identification is rapidly gaining popularity with the rise of Voice Assistants
and the like. Personalization of such products often require Speaker Identification.
There are numerous issues that need to be addressed before Speaker Identification can
be implemented on a large scale. At the highest level, all speaker recognition systems
contain two main modules:feature extraction and feature matching. One popular fea-
ture extraction technique, MFCC, is often susceptible to noise. 
<br>
MFCC is used in many speech identification applications and has a range of other applications. VQ, a clas-
sical feature mapping technique, works by dividing a large set of vectors into groups
having approximately the same number of points closest to them. In this project, a
user authentication system has been realised with a second-layer of security by speaker
identification, implemented by training a single recording of a passphrase upon reg-
istration and testing a real-time recording against the trained model to authenticate
user access using Matlab.

<b>  Introduction: </b><br>

The sound of each individual’s voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape
and size of an individual’s vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that
person’s body, especially the vocal tract, and the manner in which the speech sounds are
habitually formed and articulated. This forms a strong foundation for the use of voice as
a biometric. Although voice may not be the best form of biometrics in terms of security,
it has a lot of other advantages like the need of zero physical contact, ease of use and it’s
inherent property. Hence, to simulate a real-world application, we have implemented speaker
identification only as a second layer of security with the first one being a textual password
using Matlab.
Speaker Identification can be broadly categorised into two types: modules:Text-Dependent
and Text-Independent. In this project, we have focused on the Text-Dependent applica-
tion,i.e., identifying the speaker as well as what is being said.
